# MobileCrawler

Used for scraping HTML webpages via URL redirection in an Android emulator (e.g., Genymotion)


It includes: 

- "WebViewBrowserActivity.java" is forked from the source code of Android WebView Shell. It allows the one-tab browser to prepend a specific URL scheme to every rendered URL. 

- The "depot" folder contains an Android app, which takes redirected URLs, screenshots the web content shown on the screen, and also scrapes the entire HTML web pages.
